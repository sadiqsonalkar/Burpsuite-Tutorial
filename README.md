# Burpsuite-Tutorial
It is a burpsuite introduction and these are 5 lab I performed in Burpsuite.

Burp Suite is an integrated platform/graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
Burp Suite is a fully featured web application attack tool: it does almost anything that you could ever want to do when penetration testing a web application.

It is the most popular tool among professional web app security researchers and bug bounty hunters. Its ease of use makes it a more suitable choice over free alternatives like OWASP ZAP.
The tools offered by BurpSuite are:

Spider

Proxy

Intruder

Repeater

Sequencer
